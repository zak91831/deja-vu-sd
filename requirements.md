# Deja Vu: Next-Generation Adaptive Vulnerability Scanner

## Requirements Analysis

### Project Overview
Deja Vu is a next-generation vulnerability scanner that builds upon Nuclei's foundation while incorporating advanced features from the proposed evolution roadmap. The name "Deja Vu" reflects the tool's ability to analyze both current and historical vulnerabilities, creating a sense of "having seen this before."

### Core Requirements

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Must support plug-and-play components for each advanced feature
   - Should maintain compatibility with existing Nuclei templates
   - Must allow features to be enabled/disabled independently

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Should maintain scanning speed comparable to Nuclei
   - Must efficiently manage resource usage when ML components are active
   - Should implement caching mechanisms for expensive operations

3. **User Experience**
   - Must provide clear command-line interface with intuitive options
   - Should maintain backward compatibility with Nuclei CLI where possible
   - Must provide detailed reporting on advanced feature activities

### Feature Requirements (Prioritized)

#### Phase 1: Core Framework (Highest Priority)
- Fork and extend Nuclei's core scanning engine
- Implement plugin architecture for advanced features
- Create configuration system for feature management
- Establish metrics collection for performance monitoring

#### Phase 2: Time-Travel Scanning (High Priority)
- Integrate with Wayback Machine API
- Implement historical certificate data retrieval
- Create filtering system for relevant historical assets
- Develop scanning logic for historical endpoints

#### Phase 3: Personality-Driven Scanning (High Priority)
- Design persona configuration format
- Implement basic profiles (stealthy, aggressive, thorough)
- Create request modification system based on persona attributes
- Develop template selection logic based on persona priorities

#### Phase 4: Adaptive Learning Engine (Medium Priority)
- Implement simplified rule-based template selection
- Create technology stack detection module
- Design feedback mechanism for scan effectiveness
- Prepare infrastructure for future ML integration

#### Phase 5: Future Extensions (Lower Priority)
- Establish foundations for:
  - Self-healing templates
  - Advanced evasion techniques
  - Swarm intelligence
  - Autonomous exploit simulation

### Technical Requirements

1. **Programming Languages**
   - Primary: Go (for core engine and extensions)
   - Secondary: Python (for ML/AI components)
   - Tertiary: JavaScript (for potential web interface)

2. **Dependencies**
   - Nuclei codebase (as foundation)
   - Go modules for HTTP, DNS, and network protocols
   - Python libraries for ML/AI components
   - External APIs (Wayback Machine, certificate databases)

3. **Development Environment**
   - Go 1.18+ 
   - Python 3.9+
   - Docker for containerization and testing

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for core components
   - Integration tests for feature interactions
   - Performance benchmarks against baseline Nuclei

### Constraints and Limitations

1. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Must include safeguards against misuse
   - Should implement responsible disclosure mechanisms
   - Must provide clear documentation on ethical usage

2. **Legal Considerations**
   - Must respect terms of service for external APIs
   - Should comply with relevant cybersecurity regulations
   - Must include appropriate licensing and attribution

3. **Technical Limitations**
   - Initial ML capabilities will be simplified
   - Full GAN-based evasion will be out of scope for prototype
   - Blockchain integration will be simulated rather than implemented

### Success Criteria

1. **Minimum Viable Product**
   - Functional core framework extending Nuclei
   - Working implementation of Time-Travel Scanning
   - Basic Personality-Driven Scanning capabilities
   - Simplified Adaptive Learning foundation

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Scanning speed within 20% of baseline Nuclei
   - Successful detection of vulnerabilities in historical assets
   - Effective template selection based on basic technology detection

3. **User Acceptance**
   - Clear documentation and usage examples
   - Intuitive command-line interface
   - Valuable insights from advanced features
